1) MapClimathon:
I've made a heatmap showing households energy consumption average values by hours to show how energy using distributes across households depending on a day time. To change a timestamp u need to open In[44] and change value of "hours=30" to your timestamp (48 timestamps, 30 minutes each). The maps are displayed at the very bottom (In 46,47). To summarize: In [44] - change the timestamp, In[46] or In[47] - run any of these cells to plot a heatmap for your timestamp.
2) WorkersClimathonML:
ML model for predicting a probability of placing the employee to the home office based on historical data. Atm I have no actual data, so I decided to generate some plausible data (still in the process of finding ways to generate data) to show how it would work on real data.
